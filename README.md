### ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/riffhi-smartsho.git](https://github.com/your-username/riffhi-smartsho.git)
cd riffhi-smartsho
```
#### 2. Backend Setup
The backend consists of two services that need to run concurrently: the main API server and the chatbot server.

### a. Install Dependencies:
Navigate to the backend directory and install the required packages.

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

### b. Configure Environment Variables:
Main API Server: Create a .env file in the riffhi-smartsho/backend/ directory.
```bash
# riffhi-smartsho/backend/.env

MONGO_URI="your_mongodb_connection_string"
JWT_SECRET="your_strong_jwt_secret_key"
PORT=5000
```

Chatbot Server: Create a .env file inside the riffhi-smartsho/backend/chatbot/ directory.
```bash
# riffhi-smartsho/backend/chatbot/.env

OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your_openrouter_api_key"
```
### c. Run the Backend Servers:
You'll need two separate terminal windows for this.

Terminal 1: Start the Main API Server
```bash
# Make sure you are in the riffhi-smartsho/backend directory
node src/server.js
```

‚úÖ Your main API server should now be running on http://localhost:5000.

Terminal 2: Start the Chatbot Server
```bash
# Make sure you are in the riffhi-smartsho/backend directory
node chatbot/index.js
```

ü§ñ Your chatbot server should now be running on http://localhost:5001.

#### 3. Frontend Setup
### a. Install Dependencies:
In a new terminal, navigate to the root project directory.
```bash
# In riffhi-smartsho/
npm install
```

### b. Configure Environment Variables:
Create a .env file in the root riffhi-smartsho/ directory.
```bash
# riffhi-smartsho/.env

VITE_OPENROUTER_KEY_BUYER="your_same_openrouter_api_key"
```

### c. Run the Frontend Development Server:
